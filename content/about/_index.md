# About me!

Hi, I am Annsh Agrawaal (Pronounced: Ann-sh), a Software Developer who currently lives in Chicago, IL. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science form Unviersity of Illinois, Chicago in May 2022. I chose this field of study because I’ve always loved problem-solving. One of my key accomplishments during my academic career was building a database web application of all the UIC students that stayed in the dorms during the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m hoping to find a company where I can continue learning and growing as a Software Engineer and take on more responsibilities over time. And so I’m actively looking for a full-time position now.
